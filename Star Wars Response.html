	<p>With this game I tried to come up with some sort of idea about how encountering obstacles tends to spawn additional obstacles, making it more difficult to reach the desired end goal, but that end goal always remains, so there is still hope of reaching it.  It was difficult to come up with an idea that would work within the limited confines of the game, as there were already predetermined options available to me that severely limited what I could come up with.  At the same time, this helped me to come up with an unconventional idea because I had to be creative in order to work around the limitations imposed upon me.  It's difficult, then, to make something that is a game but also addresses some greater issue, especially if you don't know much about game development or even about what you would want to talk about when making a game to promote social awareness.  It was much easier for me to create a game without some deeper meaning than it was for me to make a game about an issue, but this may be because I had to try to make a game with the Star Wars characters available to me, which distracts me from what I might want them to represent (since they are pre-created characters with backgrounds and characteristics associated with them).</p>
